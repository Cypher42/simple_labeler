This is a very simple, very straight forward GUI for labeling binary classified images.
"Y" and "N"-Buttons reference the positive (Symbol) and negative (No Symbol) label. Pressing the Enter-Button quits the 
application without making changes to the filesystem.
The code is mostly me teaching myself a little bit of building GUIs in Python. So no gurantee for the quality.
